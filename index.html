            <h3>The ugly thing</h3>
            <p>Who is Ben Horowitz ? And what is his book about? And what’s ugly about it? The book is called “The Hard Thing About Hard Things”, which I will refer to as THTAHT.
I will tell you what’s the “Ugly thing” in a minute, but let me make it clear: the book is excellent, easily one of the best reads you can hope for. However, if you read it carefully, you will be very unhappy afterwards.of the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, also called A16Z.</p>
            <h4>Ben Hororwitz</h4>
            <p>If you are reading this blog post, I assume that you have at least a vague idea of who Ben Horowitz is.
He’s a happily married man with three wonderful kids, but most of us are interested in him because he was a technical guy that worked at Netscape and went through its spectacular IPO and acquisition, and then with Marc Andreessen founded several other ventures. Most notably, he was the CEO of LoudCloud/Opsware for several years, and he’s now the co-founder of the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, also called A16Z.</p>
            <h3>The hard thing about hard thing </h3>
            <p>On March 4th, Ben published his book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things (buy it on Amazon.com, read about it on TechCrunch), or THTAHT.
First of all, 100% of the earnings of the book will be donated to charity, and that’s a nice thing.</p>           <h4>The first part </h4>
            <p>The part of the book recalls many moments of Ben’s life, either as a kid growing up and getting to know the world, or as a young technical employee at Netscape, and later as a CEO.</p>

                <p>In essence, Ben and his partner Marc Andreessen, after taking a look at the VC landscape, and realizing that out of 800 VCs, only 6 brought acceptable returns for their investors, decide to fund a new one, based on the following principles:</p>
                <p class="qoute">“Flowers. Flowers are really cheap. But do you know what’s expensive?” he asked.
    Again, I replied, “No, what?”
    He said, “Divorce”.
    This joke made it suddenly clear that by continuing on the course I was on, I might lose my family.
    By doing everything, I would fail at the most important thing.<br/> The hard thing about the hard thing</p>
                <p>I’ve started realizing this same thing only recently, and I like to think that realizing it has saved my life. Thanks, Ben, for reminding me of this. It is too important not to think about it every day. And that’s all, folks.</p>
